## My process

I started this project with a mobile approach. I finished all of the HTML markup before beggining to style each part one by one.
After styling the header, I began working on getting the JS functionality completed for the theme toggle.
After completing, I working on styling the following two sections before moving on towards the desktop version.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I went into this project with the mindset to not overthink the styling layout and to keep it simple.
I found that by starting with a mobile approach, it was simplier to add the media queries for the desktop version.

### Useful resources

- [https://www.udemy.com/course/the-modern-flexbox-grid-sass-animations-developer-course/] - Starting this course earlier this year, I used what was shown in one of the projects to help me style the toggle button using a checkbox input as well as understanding the JS functionality for toggling the html theme.
